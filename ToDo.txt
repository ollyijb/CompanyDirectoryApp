Change GetAll function into a promise.
Tether a generator function to the successful resolution of this promise
Generator function should fill in all forms and modals so jQuery events are just click handling rather than rendering

Add an edit button which can be used to change departments location, or bring up the person editor modal.
This modal will include radio buttons and dropdowns like in the delete modal

Link all selects so they have id values for options

Design the add new entry modal
Have to create a new location before department, due to the database.

Sort out the delete functionality.
Can't delete location if department and employees are assigned to it.
Can't delete department with peoples assigned to it.
Display a message containing the dependants which still remain.

Link up the forms to DB requests handled in various php files.

Structure the script.js file so all functions are at the top sorted alphabetically. Then document.ready stuff, then jQuery events.

Extra styling to make things look nice

(low) Potentially link the rendering of flags up with the database file used in my MapApp.
